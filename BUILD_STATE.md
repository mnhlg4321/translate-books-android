## Regression status

`PASS WITH KNOWN LIMITATIONS`, based on the final v4.7 QA evidence:

- Build: successful (`clean testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug connectedDebugAndroidTest`; 73 tasks).
- JVM unit tests: 93 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Android instrumentation: 7 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped on OnePlus CPH2691 / Android 15.
- Lint: 0 errors, 50 warnings.
- Core translation and recovery regression coverage: passed within the scope recorded in `QA_REPORT_v4_7.md`.

The regression suite was not rerun during Git normalization. This file records the existing verified build state and does not claim a new build.

## Known issues

- Warm tab-switch P50 is `20 ms`, above the `16 ms` target; P95, P99, long-frame, and PSS targets passed.
- Performance evidence uses Perfetto/frame/PSS measurements rather than a dedicated Macrobenchmark module.
- The 80-swipe gesture campaign was not repeated after the final Back/pronoun cache-invalidation patch; the patch did not alter the four primary scroll containers.
- Lint reports 50 warnings and no errors.
