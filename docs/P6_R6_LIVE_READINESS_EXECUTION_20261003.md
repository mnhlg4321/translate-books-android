# P6 R6 live-readiness execution record — 2026-10-03

Scope: owner request `docs/P6_R6_LIVE_READINESS_WORK_REQUEST_20261003.md`. Complete L0–L8 offline and, after those gates pass, run G1 only within Q1's approved USD 1.00 cap; stop and report before G2. The owner answer in §6 closes L9 for the emulator and pilot. Do not read, print, store, or transfer the API key. Do not put the fingerprint in Git or output logs.

## L0 — branch and baseline

- Branch: `feature/v4.18-p5e-runner-repair-20260917`.
- HEAD: `495b30bb6b409c0c3d93a06ac1c2da220260b4ab`, which contains the L9 owner answer and is newer than the request's minimum `fbde77f6`.
- The branch was synchronized with origin. The working tree had pre-existing owner edits and untracked evidence/artifacts in `.idea`, P5E documentation/scripts, `raw/`, `evidence/`, `artifacts/`, and owner backup folders. These were not staged, reset, cleaned, or moved.
- L9: §6 records that the same key is saved in app Settings on `emulator-5554` and pilot `15e84958`, and the supplied fingerprint applies to both. This is owner-provided placement evidence; the runner must still validate emulator Settings before dispatch.
- At L0 completion: no provider call, key read, pilot access, device operation, or database change was performed. No call or spend has been incurred in this live-readiness sequence.
- **L0 PASS.**

## L1–L8

Pending.

## G1

Not started. Authorized only after L0–L8 pass; maximum total spend USD 1.00; zero retries or repair calls; stop on UNKNOWN or cap exhaustion. Report separately before G2.

## Current next action

Implement L1's opt-in live fixture path with on-device settings-route and fingerprint checks. All refusal paths must stop before provider dispatch.
